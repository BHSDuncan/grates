============

Blueprints-based graph date representation and library.

Overall goals:

- Create a useful graph-based library based on Blueprints.
- Have the library reused by any JVM-based language.

Design goals:

- Simple data structure.
- Compact/scalable "calendar" representation.
- Efficient/fast lookups and comparisons.

Answer these questions (to start):

1. What date is \<event A\> on?

2. What \<events\> occur on a given date?

3. What \<events\> occur within a given date range?

4. Does \<event A\> occur after <event B>?

5. Does \<event A\> happen on the same date as <event B>?

6. Does \<event A\> happen within a given date range?

(and a "stretch goal" (not so much a question) is modeling and answering questions to recurring/multi-date events)
